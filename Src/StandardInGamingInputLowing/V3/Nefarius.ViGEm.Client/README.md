## About

.NET API to interact with features offered by [ViGEm Bus Driver](https://github.com/nefarius/ViGEmBus).

## Installation

This library can be consumed via [pre-built NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Nefarius.ViGEm.Client/):

```PowerShell
Install-Package Nefarius.ViGEm.Client
```

## Examples

### Get full output report of an emulated DS4

> Requires ViGEmBus v1.19.418 or newer.

```csharp
using Nefarius.ViGEm.Client;

// initializes the SDK instance
var client = new ViGEmClient();

// prepares a new DS4
var ds4 = client.CreateDualShock4Controller();

// brings the DS4 online
ds4.Connect();

// recommended: run this in its own thread
while (true)
    try
    {
        // blocks for 250ms to not burn CPU cycles if no report is available
        // an overload is available that blocks indefinitely until the device is disposed, your choice!
        var buffer = ds4.AwaitRawOutputReport(250, out var timedOut);

        if (timedOut)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Timed out");
            continue;
        }

        // you got a new report, parse it and do whatever you need to do :)
        // here we simply hex-dump the contents
        Console.WriteLine($"[OUT] {string.Join(" ", buffer.Select(b => b.ToString("X2")))}");
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(ex.ToString());
        Thread.Sleep(1000);
    }
```
